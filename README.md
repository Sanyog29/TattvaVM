# **TattvaVM** 🖥️⚡  
🚀 **A Custom Virtual Machine for Programmers, Built from Scratch**  

TattvaVM is a lightweight, terminal-based **Virtual Machine** designed to execute custom instructions efficiently. Inspired by Sanskrit, "Tattva" (तत्त्व) means **principle or essence**, reflecting the core computing functions of this project.  

## 🔥 **Key Features**  
✅ **Arithmetic Operations** – Addition, Factorial, Modulo, Power, GCD, Bitwise, Sorting  
✅ **Debugging Tools** – TRACE (Instruction Logging), DUMP (Memory & Register Snapshot)  
✅ **Multi-Language Debugging** – Supports **Java & C++ file debugging**  
✅ **Custom Instruction Set & Execution Flow** – Fetch-Decode-Execute cycle  
✅ **Memory Management & Registers** – Efficient handling of computations  
✅ **Planned Features** 🚀  
   - **Bytecode Execution** for optimized performance  
   - **Open-Source Collaboration** – Contributions welcome!  

## 🛠 **How It Works**  
1️⃣ Load instructions into TattvaVM  
2️⃣ Execute operations based on custom instruction set  
3️⃣ Debug with TRACE & DUMP to analyze execution  

## Project Structure

- `src/main/java/vm/` - Main package containing the VM implementation
  - `CPU.java` - Simulates the CPU with registers and instruction execution
  - `Instruction.java` - Defines the instruction set for the VM
  - `Memory.java` - Simulates memory with read/write operations
  - `Program.java` - Represents a program that can be loaded and executed
  - `Register.java` - Represents a CPU register
  - `VirtualMachine.java` - Main class that ties

## 📂 **Getting Started**  
Clone the repository:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/TattvaVM.git
cd TattvaVM
```
Run the VM:  
```bash
java -jar TattvaVM.jar
```
